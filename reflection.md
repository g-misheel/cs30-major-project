# Reflection

## What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?

- Don't overthink the little details that don't matter much. Spending too much time perfecting things like centering elements took away focus from the bigger picture.
- Gather your images and sounds before you actually start coding so that you won't be distracted when actually coding.

## Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?

- Yes, I completed everything on my needs-to-have list


## What was the hardest part of the project?
- One of the hardest things was to make the game look like the original, I've tried to make the changes in css and HTML, however, it didn't look as good as I was hoping for.
- Another was making multiple levels and changing the target variables accordingly

## Were there any problems you could not solve?

- I couldn't figure out how to change html pages using javascript, I was hoping I could make another page instead of just having a 'congrats' message
